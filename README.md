# Sales_forcasting
This project builds a sales forecasting model using a Random Forest Regressor. It predicts weekly sales based on features like store, temperature, fuel price, and economic data. The model is trained, evaluated using MAE and RMSE, and predictions are compared with actual sales for accuracy tracking.
